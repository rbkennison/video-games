    <h1>My first day</h1>
    <!-- paragraph -->
    <p>My bear wants me beep bop boop and learn code. I pretend to be bad at it but in reality i am like way so much better than her.
        Also did you know that ducks go quack. Been there, done that, gotcha ya, who's there, but yeah! Wow what a day. Speaking of WoW I used to play
        an obscene amount of Wow. Oh those were the days. My wife looks onto me not knowing that her eyes once vibrant and filled with life had grown gray
        and old. Oh how I wonder what my next lover will be like. Well until next time. This had bee a paragrah by none of there St. Charles von Winter Weiner
        the 3rd.
